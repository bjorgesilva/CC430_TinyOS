CC430f5137 on TinyOS

I have a CC430F5137 based mote on which I'm trying to get TinyOS to run. Although the CC430
is supported in TinyOS by the SURF platform, I had to change the pin settings on the tinyprod code to match the 
LED and UART connections on my mote:

LED1 (Red) ----> Connected to P1.7
LED2 (Green) ----> Connected to P3.6
LED3 (Orange) ----> Connected to P3.7

UART RX -----> Connected to P2.0
UART TX -----> Connected to P2.1

The files in this repo are the files from tinyprod I had to change to reflect my pin connections.
